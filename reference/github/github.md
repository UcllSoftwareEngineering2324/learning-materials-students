# GitHub

GitHub as a version control system needs no introduction, but GitHub anno 2023 is much more than an upstream git repository. You can use GitHub as a platform to manage your entire application, from planning til deployment.

We will use the following parts of GitHub in this course:
* [GitHub Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)
* [GitHub Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)
* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
* [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages)

The general documentation landing page can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en).

Refer to the other pages for more resources about GitHub actions and packages.
