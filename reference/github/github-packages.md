# GitHub Packages

GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly.

GitHub Packages are stored _on orgonization level_, but they inherit access rights from the repositories that published them.

GitHub Packages behaves like an npm registry in the case of an npm package and like a maven registry in the case of a maven artifact.
