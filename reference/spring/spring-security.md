Note that some of these resources can be a bit outdated with regards to how
the `SecurityFilterChain` is created. See the reference documentation for
[`HttpSecurity`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/builders/HttpSecurity.html)
