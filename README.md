Open this folder in Visual Studio Code to easily work with all the documents.

## Getting Updates

It is a good idea to check for updates before you start working!

## Working with markdown

Every document is presented as a _markdown_ file.

A markdown file is a text file that uses markup syntax to add formatting and structure to the text. It is often used to create documentation.

You can view the source code of the markdown file by opening the file. By selecting the preview button you can view the compiled document.

### Open preview by default

Since you'll be reading markdown files instead of writing them most of the time it might be useful to change the default behaviour to preview mode.

Go to Settings -> Workbench -> Editor Associations. Select "Add Item" and add the value `vscode.markdown.preview.editor` for item `*.md`. 

Markdown files are now openend in preview instead of source code by default.
