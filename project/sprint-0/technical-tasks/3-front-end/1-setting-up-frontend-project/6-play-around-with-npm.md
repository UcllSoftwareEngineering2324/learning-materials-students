# Play around with NPM

When building your cicd pipeline you will need to build and start the application manually (i.e. without help of your IDE). We will practice this locally in this story.

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

Make sure that you can:
* Do a local build of your next.js project using npm
* Run the output of the local build

## 2. Implementation Details

We will need a standalone build for the cicd-pipeline, so it might be worth it to already look at configuring a standalone build.

1. Configure a local build
    * https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output
    * https://tech.competa.com/standalone-deployment-of-nextjs-3286490cb39b
1. Verify that the build works by executing the following steps:
    1. Make an empty new directory
    1. Copy public from your project to public in the new folder
    1. Copy .next/static from your project to .next/static in the new folder
    1. Copy the contents of .next/standalone into the root of the new folder
    1. Execute `node server.js` in the newly created directory to see if the build works
1. If this works, add the following to the scripts tag in `package.json`: `"start": "node server.js"`
    * `npm run start` will be automatically ran by Azure after deploying
    * Adding this script makes sure that our application will be startup correctly by Azure
