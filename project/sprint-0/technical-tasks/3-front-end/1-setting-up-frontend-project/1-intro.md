# Intro

In these tasks we will start building cicd pipelines for the frontend. The ultimate goal is that your **default branch (normally "main")** will be build and deployed to Azure every time you push new code.
In this sprint we will only build a small part, we will finish the pipelines in sprint-1.

You are encouraged to go through the reference material so that you have the necessary background knowledge.

## 1. Reference

* [npm](./../../../../../reference/npm/npm.md)
    * Stands for Node Package Manager
    * Originally a package manager for node applications
    * Currently the mostly used build tool in the Javascript ecosystem
    * You will need to interact with npm directly when writing the build pipelines
