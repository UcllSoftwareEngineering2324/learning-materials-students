# Manage rent

Renter users need to check in and check out a rent he/she has done in the Car4Rent application. When checking in and checking out, the renter needs to register some information (for instance the current mileage, the fuel quantity, the start date end start time, ...) in order to be able to calculate the costs of this rent to create the payments.
