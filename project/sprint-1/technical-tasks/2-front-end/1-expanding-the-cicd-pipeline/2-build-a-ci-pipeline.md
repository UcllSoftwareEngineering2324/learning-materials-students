# Build a ci pipeline

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

At the end of this task you should have a workflow in your GitHub repository with one job that performs the following steps every time code is pushed on the default branch:

1. Checkout the code
2. Setup the Node version
3. Trigger a build 
    * If tests are failing, the workflow should fail!
4. Deploy to GitHub packages

The workflow file should contain no sensitive information.

## 2. Implementation Details

Make sure to look at the generated workflow for inspiration for some of these sections.

### 2.1. Code the workflow trigger

1. Make it so that the workflow triggers every time code is pushed to the main branch

### 2.2. Checkout the code

1. Create a job for the workflow
1. The first step of the workflow should checkout the code

### 2.3. Setup the Node version

1. Add a step that makes sure that the rest of the job uses the Node version required by your Next.js app
    * You can see the Node version your app depends on in `package.json`

### 2.4. Trigger a build

1. Use npm to automate as much of this step as possible
    * The workflow should fail if not all tests are green
1. You should create a _standalone_ build so that the build output can be ran on its own
    * https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output
    * https://tech.competa.com/standalone-deployment-of-nextjs-3286490cb39b
    * You can verify that your standalone build works by executing the same steps locally:
        1. Make a empty new directory
        1. Copy public from your project to public in the new folder
        1. Copy .next/static from your project to .next/static in the new folder
        1. Copy the contents of .next/standalone into the root of the new folder
        1. Execute `node server.js` in the newly created directory to see if the build works
    * If it works locally, code the creation of the standalone build in your workflow
1. Add the following to the scripts tag in `package.json`: `"start": "node server.js"`
    * `npm run start` will be automatically ran by Azure after deploying
    * Adding this script makes sure that our application will be startup correctly by Azure

It is best to do work like this in two steps:
1. First verify everything on your local machine
1. If that works code what you just did in the workflow

### 2.5. Deploy to GitHub packages

1. We will start from a successful build
1. First create a standalone output folder from the build results
    1. Make a empty new directory
    1. Copy public from your project to public in the new folder
    1. Copy .next/static from your project to .next/static in the new folder
    1. Copy .next/standalone into the root of the new folder
    1. Execute `node server.js` in the newly created directory
1. Now publish the standalone output folder to GitHub Packages
    1. The node_modules should **not** be published, only the code files
    1. Try to work with `npm publish` and config in your `package.json`
        * Other approaches are possible, but this is the cleanest way
