# Build a ci pipeline

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

At the end of this task you should have a workflow in your GitHub repository with one job that performs the following steps every time code is pushed on the default branch:

1. Checkout the code
2. Setup the Java version
3. Trigger a full maven build that ends with a deploy to GitHub packages
    * If tests are failing, the workflow should fail!

The workflow file should contain no sensitive information.

## 2. Implementation Details

Make sure to look at the generated workflow for inspiration for some of these sections.

### 2.1. Code the workflow trigger

1. Make it so that the workflow triggers every time code is pushed to the main branch

### 2.2. Checkout the code

1. Create a job for the workflow
1. The first step of the workflow should checkout the code

### 2.3. Setup the Java version

1. Add a step that makes sure that the rest of the job uses Java 17

### 2.4. Build and deploy to GitHub packages

1. Use maven to automate as much of this step as possible
    * The workflow should fail if not all tests are green
