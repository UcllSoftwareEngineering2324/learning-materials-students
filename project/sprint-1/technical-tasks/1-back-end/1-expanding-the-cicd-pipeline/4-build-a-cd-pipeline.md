# Build a cd pipeline

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

At the end of this task you should have a workflow in your GitHub repository with one job that performs the following steps:

1. Download the package from GitHub Packages
2. Deploy the package to Azure

The workflow file should contain no sensitive information.

## 2. Implementation Details

Make sure to look at the generated workflow for inspiration for some of these sections.

### 2.1. Code the workflow trigger

It is up to you how you trigger this workflow. Automatically on an appropriate trigger action or manually.

The documentation about workflow triggers can be found here:
* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#registry_package

If you do it manually than this link might contain useful information:

### 2.2. Download the package from GitHub Packages

This is another step that will require some creativity.

Some options:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64969548/how-to-download-a-jar-from-github-package-registry-for-a-specific-release-versio

### 2.3. Deploy the package to Azure

1. You are almost there, check the workflow Azure generated for this step

### 2.4. Debugging Azure

Here are some places to look if your application is not starting up as expected and you have no clue what is wrong:
1. You can view logs from deployments in `Deployment Center`
1. You can view logs from your application after deploy in `Overview` > `Logs`
1. You can start an SSH session to your app in `SSH`
    * This will only work if your deployment and startup did not crash!

### 2.5. Finishing up

1. Hurray, your automated pipeline works!
1. You may remove the generated workflow-file from sprint-0, everything useful is copied to the new pipelines.
