# Frontend should call backend

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

After this story your frontend app on Azure should display information from your backend app on Azure.

## 2. Implementation Details

Currently, your frontend app on Azure will probably talk to your backend running on `localhost`. It goes without saying that this won't be very successful...

1. Configure Next.js in production by using separate configuration for every environment: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables

## Epilogue

Congratulations! You have a fully working automated pipeline that takes your source code and publishes it to Azure.

There is a lot more that we could do:

* For example, the frontend app is calling the backend app over the internet. Since they are both running on Azure, the frontend could call the backend over a local network.
* Here is an article detailing a more robust setup on Azure: https://azure.github.io/AppService/2022/12/02/n-tier-web-app.html#create-staging-slots-and-configure-continuous-deployment
* We won't go that far, you will learn more about Azure in the cloud courses.
